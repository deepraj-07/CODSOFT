# 🐍 Python Internship Projects – CodSoft

Welcome to the official repository of my **Python Development Internship** at **CodSoft** – a hands-on internship opportunity focused on developing problem-solving skills and real-world coding experience.

Throughout this internship, I worked on beginner-friendly yet logic-driven tasks that strengthened my command of Python fundamentals. Here's a breakdown of what I’ve built.

## 📌 About the Internship

The CodSoft internship emphasizes **practical learning**, creativity, and coding discipline. Over the span of the internship, I completed **three core Python projects**, each targeting essential programming constructs like conditionals, loops, functions, and user interaction.

All projects were coded from scratch, with a clean structure and some enhancements for usability and code readability.

### ✅ Task 1 – Multi-Feature Calculator

An interactive calculator supporting multiple operations and a calculation history log.

- Supports: Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Modulus, Power, Floor Division  
- Input validation for numeric values  
- Handles division/modulus by zero  
- Option to view all past calculations in history  
- Clean loop-based console UI with exit command

### ✅ Task 2 – Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

Classic RPS game with scoring and round-based gameplay against the computer.

- Accepts user choice and randomly generates computer move  
- Implements core win/draw/lose logic  
- Keeps score for both user and computer  
- Repeats rounds until the player quits  
- Final result announced based on scores

### ✅ Task 3 – Password Generator

Customizable password generator with three levels of strength.

- User sets desired password length  
- Options for Letters Only, Letters + Numbers, or Full (Symbols included)  
- Secure password generation using `random` and `string` modules  
- Validates all inputs and displays final password with a safety tip

## 💼 Optional Add-ons (Coming Soon or Planned)

If time allows, I plan to enhance this repository with:

🔐 A basic login/signup system using file handling  
🧮 A simple quiz app using dictionaries and scoring logic  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Python 3**
- Console-based UI
- `random`, `string`, and basic modules
- IDE: VS Code + Terminal Debugging

---

## 🧩 Lessons Learned

- Writing reusable functions makes code cleaner and easier to debug  
- User input validation is key to a better user experience  
- Even simple projects require thoughtful logic and testing  
- Planning before coding saves time later
